## Project Structure  

- `sentiment_score_for_cen.ipynb`  
  Main notebook containing the model code and step-by-step explanation.  

- `README.md`  
  Documentation for understanding and running the project.  

---

## How It Works  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleans and preprocesses the Flipkart reviews dataset.  
   - Converts text data into numerical labels (positive: `1`, negative: `0`).  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Builds a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow.  
   - Trains the model to predict the impact of chatbots on customer sentiment.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Provides clear plots to demonstrate the relationship between input features and predictions.

## Running the Project  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryansama9/Chatbot-linear-regression-model.git
   cd Chatbot-linear-regression-model
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_score_for_cen.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:  
   - Load the dataset.  
   - Train and evaluate the linear regression model.  
   - Visualize results and insights.

## Results  

The notebook will output:  
- Model training loss and accuracy.  
- Graphs illustrating chatbot impact predictions on customer sentiment.

---

## Future Enhancements  

- Expand the model to include multiple regression for richer insights.  
- Apply NLP techniques like sentiment classification for better text data analysis.  
- Explore other machine learning models for comparison.
